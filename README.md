1. William Cody Henopp
2. Southwest Tech
3. Software Development
   1. This item exists because it is an assignment for my class.
   2. My name is Cody Henopp and I love to be outdoors and also work with computers. My favorite food is pizza and I actually work for Pizanos Pizzeria in Brian Head, Utah and I really enjoy it. During the winter any time I get the chance I will be up snowboarding and just having a good time with friends.
   3. My end goal with taking this class will be to get into a company that can further my knowledge and skills to be able to eventually do things on my own. I would love to be able to create an app or two and to also be able to use my skills to start my own company and help other companies to thrive.
