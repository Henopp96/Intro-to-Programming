  i. This is the final project needed for this course.

  ii. I have created a simple battleship game that allows the first player to enter in a location for a single 3X1 ship and then 
    allows the second player to shoot for the ship.
  
   iii. The program will keep going if the second player doesn't find the ship and will end once they have hit all 3 points where the
    ship is located.
