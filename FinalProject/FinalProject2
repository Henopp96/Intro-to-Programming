 * Comments: I am having problems with storing where the ship is located and keeping it in the new matrix so that I can 
 * 		then read them in the shooter array from the ship array. If I make the brackets into 0's then I will have it print with 
 * 		0's where the ship is located and I can easily tell the program that if it is a 0 then it is a hit and if it is a bracket
 * 		then it is a miss. I am just having problems with keeping the ship as a bracket and then later being able to tell the 
 * 		difference of the brackets where the ship is located and the brackets of the rest of the matrix.
